# ForecastPro-A-Time-Series-project
A Time series project with seasonal and non-seasonal dataset.


Built time series models (ARIMA, SARIMA, GARCH) on seasonal and non-seasonal datasets to forecast retail profit and stock price trends.

Performed stationarity testing (ADF), model selection (AIC/BIC), and residual diagnostics (Shapiro-Wilk, Ljung-Box) for robust forecasting.

Developed forecasts using Python with train-test splits and full-data approaches, enhancing predictive reliability and model interpretability.

Visualized autocorrelation patterns using ACF/PACF plots to guide model architecture and improve forecast accuracy.

Improved model fit by applying differencing and detrending techniques to ensure time series stationarity.

Identified limitations in ARIMA/GARCH models and proposed future enhancement using LSTM or hybrid ML models.
